sysmon

System monitoring for my server.

DESCRIPTION

This is a collection of scripts and programs that I wrote to monitor my server
running Ethereum consensus and execution clients.

USAGE

The tool uses RRDtool (https://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/) to collect metrics. It
must be installed for the tool to function. Reading the manpages of RRDtool is
highly recommended.

Run init.sh to create the round-robin databases. Then compile the go files and
run sysmon to collect metrics and serve graphs through HTTP on port 9999.

Everything is hardcoded. Some customizations that a user may want to make are
	- Style of the graphs, such as timespan, colors, and labels. They are
	  defined in graph.sh.
	- Amount (duration and granularity) of data stored. They are defined in
	  init.sh. One may also want to modify main.go to adjust how frequently
	  metrics are collected.
	- Address and port to which the HTTP server serving the graphs binds.
	  They are defined in main.go.
	- How metrics are collected. They are defined in update_progress.sh
	  (Ethereum clients) and update_resource.sh (system resources).
